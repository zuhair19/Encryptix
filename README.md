## Java Projects
This repository contains several Java projects demonstrating different programming concepts and applications. The projects include:

1. Number Game
2. Student Grade Calculator
3. ATM Interface

### Project 1: Number Game

#### Overview
The Number Game is a console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and tracks the score based on the number of attempts.


#### Features
- Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
- Allows up to 10 attempts to guess the number.
- Provides feedback on guesses (too high or too low).
- Keeps track of the score based on the number of attempts used.
- Option to play again.

### Project 2: Student Grade Calculator
#### Overview
The Student Grade Calculator calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade based on user input for several subjects. It uses a simple grading scale to determine the final grade.

#### Features
- Accepts marks for a predefined number of subjects (5 in this case).
- Calculates the total marks and average percentage.
- Determines the grade based on the average percentage.

### Project 3: ATM Interface
#### Overview
The ATM Interface simulates a basic ATM using Java. Users can check their balance, deposit funds, and withdraw money. It uses a BankAccount class to manage account operations and a Main class for the user interface.

#### Features
- Check account balance.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money from the account.
- Exit the ATM interface.
